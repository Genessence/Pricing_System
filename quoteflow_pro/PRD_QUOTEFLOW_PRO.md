## ðŸ”¢ **RFQ Numbering System**

### **Format Specification**
**Pattern**: `GP-{SITE_CODE}-{GLOBAL_SEQUENCE}`

### **Components**
- **GP**: General Purchase prefix (fixed)
- **SITE_CODE**: Plant/Site identifier (A001, A002, A003, etc.)
- **GLOBAL_SEQUENCE**: Sequential number that increments globally across ALL sites

### **Examples**
- `GP-A001-001` - First RFQ globally (from Plant A)
- `GP-A002-002` - Second RFQ globally (from Plant B)
- `GP-A001-003` - Third RFQ globally (from Plant A)
- `GP-A003-004` - Fourth RFQ globally (from Plant C)

### **Key Principles**
1. **Global Sequence**: The last 3 digits increment globally across ALL plants, not per plant
2. **Site Identification**: The middle part identifies which plant/site the RFQ originates from
3. **Uniqueness**: Each RFQ number is unique across the entire system
4. **Scalability**: As new plants are added, the sequence continues globally

### **Business Logic**
- When Plant A creates the first RFQ: `GP-A001-001`
- When Plant B creates the next RFQ: `GP-A002-002` (not `GP-A002-001`)
- When Plant A creates another RFQ: `GP-A001-003`
- This ensures global tracking and prevents numbering conflicts across plants
